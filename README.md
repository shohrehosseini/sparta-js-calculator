#Calculator


##Tasks
In this task, I am going to use JavaScript to write a command line calculator application that has two settings, (b)asic and (a)dvanced.

* First I ask the user for which calculator they want to use
* Then, based on the selected ssetting, I ask the user for the number(s) to operate on. I used if/else for this step.
* Then, I need to write if/elseif/ else to apply functions on number(s).

The basic calculator must be able to run the following operations:

- Additon
- Multiplication
- Division
- Subtraction

And, the advanced alculator must be able to run the following operations:

- Power
- Square root

##Bonus task 

- Add some additional functionality
- Add the following calculator feature into your app:

####BMI Calculator
Calculate the BMI when given the height and weight

- the user should be able to choose between the imperial and the metric system
- BMI Link 1
- BMI Link 1

####SUPER Bonus task
Add the following calculator feature into your app.

####Trip Calculator
This feature asks the user for four inputs; 

- distance,
- fuel efficiency (mpg),
- cost per gallon, 
- speed

and it will give you the time and price of your journey.

####Example output:
"Your trip will take 3.5 hours and cost Â£255.33.""

####Note:
For every 1 MPH over 60 MPH, reduce the the MPG by 2 MPG (i.e. a car that normally gets 30 mpg would only get 28 mpg if its speed were 61 mph. Yes this gets silly at high speed where mpg goes to zero or gets negative - how will you handle this?)
